	<p> "Everyone 'does gender' without thinking about it" (Lorber, 1) 
        <br>has been a phrase that has stuck with me since the moment I read it. <br>
        Gender is so innate while also being the most fabricated, <br> 
        <a href="#poem1">carelessly constructed concept</a> known to man.<br>
</div>

<div id="q1_2">

        Is that woman enough for you?</p>

    Gender is a division of the roles "male" <br>
    and "female" formed by societal norms. <br>
    Far more genders exist than these two<br> 
    roles, and as time goes on they are finally <br>
    becoming more recognized.

    Sex is determined at birth by ones <br>
    biology/chromosomes. Still, sex can <br>
    extend past the binary of "male" and <br>
    "female", such as intersex.

    Gender identity is a more internal view <br>
     of one's own gender. Much like <br>
     sexuality, gender identity may require deep <br>
     introspection to uncover. Gender <br>
     identity does not have to align <br>
     with one's gender.Gender identity is also <br>
     separate from gender expression. In many <br>
     cases, like the situation outlined by <br>
     Mary Beth Norton in "'Searches again Assembled'""<br>
     , for a person who does not perfectly fit <br>
     into predetermined sex and gender categories,<br>
      society panics. They run to "create a <br>
      unique category that combined sex and <br>
      gender for T alone" (Norton, 69).

    Sexuality is who someone is attracted to,<br>
     how they are attracted to someone, <br>
     when they are attracted to someone, or <br>
     more. Sexuality is completely fluid and <br>
     up to every person's own decision. What <br>
     widely used to be considered a battle between <br>
     identifying as gay or straight is now an <br>
     option between endless labels.

    The gender binary is a term<br>
    that refers to the social construct<br>
    of two binary male and <br>
    female genders. This term opposes<br>
    the idea of a genderspectrum, which is <br>
    inclusive to all gender identities.

    Oppression threads its way through every inch of women's lives. <br>
    One very prevalent issue is reproductive rights.<br>
     As bell hooks says ",the right of women to choose whether<br>
      or not to have an abortion is only one aspect of reproductive <br>
      freedom." There are hundreds of other reproductive rights women <br>
      need, from hysterectomies to birth control. For abortion to be<br>
       made illegal is <a href="#poem2">one stepping stone in the larger pond</a> of restricting<br>
        women from having rights to their own bodies at all. <br>
        This is also completely parallel to the constant "threat of violence..., <br>
        not just the rape or battering... but also that... one quite likely will <br>
        not be honored in court" (Pharr, 57). It is not just a constant <br>
        power over feminine bodies, but feminine minds and liberties.

    As far back as humanity has proof of, <br>
    gender has been an ingrained subject. <br>
    From the typical cavemen "hunters v. gatherers" <br>
    to biblical "Adam and Eve", femininity has <br>
    been viewed as less capable. These gender constructs <br>
    are very rooted in whiteness, as in other cultures <br>
    and practices, the gender binary was not ingrained.<br>
    Even "the Iroquois model included considerably more <br>
    political and economic power for women than <br>
    any Europeans considered possible" (Evans, 35).<br>
    Still, founding fathers could not fathom how women <br>
    should be <a href="#poem3">respected to any degree</a> at all.

    Feminism is the push for gender equality not only politically <br>
    and economically but socially. Feminism is <a href="#poem4">a lifelong fight</a> <br>
    for femininity to be respected in the same regard to masculinity. <br>
    "Feminist consciousness-raising for males is as essential to revolutionary<br>
     movement as female groups," (Hooks, 11). Proactive feminism is <br>
     a teaching taught from birth to ensure growth in the next generations.

<div id="q5">
    The feminist movement has long been tainted with<br>
     racism and discrimination; middle or upper class white <br>
     women took the forefront of media appearances to <br>
     peddle their needs. There was a disregard <br>
     for the needs of BIPOC women and feminine individuals who <br>
     were fighting for <a href="#poem5">far more</a> than these white women could <br>
     imagine. The first wave was often centered on the <br>
     right to vote from white women. The second wave, however, <br>
     shifted to equality and a push to demolish discrimination. <br>
     Only in the third wave was there a shift towards addressing <br>
     the privilege in the whole movement coming from rich, white women.
